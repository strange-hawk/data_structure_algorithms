used when we have random connections among items
- not linear
- no heirarchial
vertices(nodes) and edges(arcs)

graph representations:
- adjacency matrix
- adjacency list


ADJACENCY MATRIX: 
- xtra space wastage
-  quickly check for direct connections


ADJACENCY LIST:
- quickly find out all adjacents

implementation using adjacency list in  C++: vector<int> adj[V];(adjacency list using array of vector in cpp)
