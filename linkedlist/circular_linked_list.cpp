// next of last node is the first node
// // advantages
// we can traverse the whole list from any node
// we can insert any item at both beginning and end in O(1) time by maintaining just one poiner (can be useful for queue implementation)
// implementing algorithms like round robin

// disadvantage
// insertion/deletion/traversal become slightly complex

// singly_linked and doubly linked list
