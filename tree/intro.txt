application of tree:
- hierarchical data
    organisational data
    folder structure
    XML/HTML content
    In OOP

- binary search tree
- binary heap
- B and B+ tree in DBMS
- spanning and shortest path trees in computer networks
- parse tree, expansion tree in compiler
- trie 
- suffix tree -> for pattern searching
- binary  search tree -> query searches within range ; faster for limited searches
- segment tree -> query searches



Binary Tree
every node has atmost 2 children
binary search tree is variation of binary tree
most of the practical tree are binary trees

Tree traversal
means printing every key of the tree every once
Breadth first (or level order)
Depth first - we move to one side of tree, traverse all the keys and then move to other side
- inorder -> left root right , complexity -> O(n)
- preorder -> root left right, complexity -> O(n)
- postorder -> left right root, complexity -> O(n)
