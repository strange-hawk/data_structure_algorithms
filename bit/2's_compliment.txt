to get the 2's compliemnt of x in n bit representation
->  2^n - x

to compute ~5 where 5 is signed
-> 2^32 - 1 (if all the 32 bit were 1) - 5
-> comp. it with 2^n - x
-> -6
-> left shift/right shift of signed numbers is generally not recommended because it is undefined (compiler dependant)
-> similarly tilde operator is not recommended
-> 2's compliemnt is compiler dependant
